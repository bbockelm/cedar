// bare user. ALLOW_*/DENY_* lists are matched against the whole FQU, while the
// user part alone is what C++ calls the owner (Sock::getOwner), e.g. a job's
// Owner attribute.

// Guessing is worse than having nothing to go on. A guessed domain is
// indistinguishable downstream from a configured one, so the caller that does
// know the real UID_DOMAIN -- a map file, or server.FQUMapper, which qualifies
// a name that arrives without an '@' -- sees an identity that is already
// qualified and leaves it alone. The peer is then authorized as user@<guess>,
// which matches no ALLOW_<PERM> rule written for the pool's UID domain and
// which the daemon cannot tell apart from a genuinely foreign identity. A bare
// name is at least true, and the layer above can still complete it.
