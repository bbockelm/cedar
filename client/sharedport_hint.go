// HTCondor's shared_port server accepts the TCP connection on the shared port and then
// splices it to the target daemon's named unix socket. The client sends its
// SHARED_PORT_CONNECT request fire-and-forget (shared_port sends no reply) and proceeds
// straight into the CEDAR handshake with whatever is on the other side. When no daemon is
// registered under that socket name -- it is still starting up, has exited, or was just
// restarted -- shared_port resets the connection, and the only symptom the client sees is
// a bare "connection reset by peer" on its first read, with nothing to say shared_port
// routing was even involved. Wrap that into something an operator can act on.
//
// Non-shared-port addresses, and shared-port failures that carry a real protocol/auth
// message (not a bare reset), are returned unchanged.
